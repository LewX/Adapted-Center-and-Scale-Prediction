ATTENTION: I will release my codes about the paper [**Adapted Center and Scale Prediction: More stable and More Accurate**](<https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09053>). This is the official pytorch implementation. However, because my paper is based on [**High-level Semantic Feature Detection: A New Perspective for Pedestrian Detection**](<https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02948>) and my ability is limited, I choose to use the codes from [**CSP PyTorch Implementation**](<https://github.com/lw396285v/CSP-pedestrian-detection-in-pytorch>). Many thanks for his contributionÔºÅ

#I will release my codes(adaptations) as soon as possible! However, due to heavy schooling, it may be delayed.

# ACSP PyTorch Implementation


## NOTE
Please do not run the codes until I finish uploading. The followings are constructing!
